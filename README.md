# tex
it is 2:23 in the morning and im coding like usually

this script is a real simple script that allows me to get
with scp files from a distant server!

mostly because i am lazy to do the same command each time. 

after getting the script don't forget to 
  chmod +x tex 
and add in .bashrc the line 
  alias tex="directorywhereTEXis"
